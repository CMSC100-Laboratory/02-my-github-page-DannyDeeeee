Steps on how to create a GitHub page: <br>
1. Make sure that the repository is set to public <br>
    • Go to settings <br>
    • In general tab, scroll down <br>
    • In the danger zone section you will see "change repository visibility" <br>
    • That is where you can check! <br>
2. Setting up the page
    • While in settings, go to the pages tab <br>
    • Look for the "Build and Deployment" section <br>
    • Select the branch that you want the github page to display <br>
    • Choose root then save <br>
    • Wait for a while and it should show the link to you <br>
3. That's it! <br>

What are your key takeaways from this exercise?:
<br>**As someone who transferred from another uni that didn't teach html but still got credited to take cs 100, I think flexbox is very effective at alot of things. Though I also used things like grid.**<br>
    **But along with that, I also get to capitalize on this exercise by honing my newbie skills!**
