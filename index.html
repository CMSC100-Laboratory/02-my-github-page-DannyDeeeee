					Born from Muntinlupa City, I am a ** year-old student who first wound up in the UP System where I first studied at University of the Philippines Baguio for a year, but has transferred, and is now currently studying for his second year undergraduate BS Computer Science degree at University of the Philippines Los Baños.
					<br><br>
					Gaming was the largest reason as to why I got into programming and the likes. I appreciate all the details that the developers put into their game, and how they do it all while the users just have to touch keys and wave their mouses. I remember how naive I was, thinking about how long these devs take their time making games and how hard it would be to make the most detailed game possible. A few years later I have gotten (kind of) grasp of it, yet the painstaking amount of work that it will take never discouraged me to be curious >:(
					<br><br>
					When the Pandemic struck and classes were suspended, my bored ** year-old self discovered Blender, which is a free open-source 3d software. I first started following that guy who makes those goofy donut tutorial videos, then started making models myself, they were not really good, but at the time, I was happy to be able to make something.
					<br><br>
					Then, my interest just grew and grew, and before I knew it, I had found my niche, making viewmodel animations. At first they were simple and generic, but I kept on refining them and posting them on my yt channel, and eventually, I hit 175 subscribers!!! Yay!! (Though these animations are still not good though, I must keep on going…)
					<br><br>
					But then, my grades were good, and my upcat score was good, and I GOT INTO UP OORAH!!!
					And this is where I learn about programming along with the other 3 languages, with c being one of the most dominant ones (c-sharp was 10 percent because I touched on unity).
